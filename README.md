# System Design  
This repository contains examples of many popular system design concepts. The goal of this repo is to provide a clear understanding of how system design fundamentals come into play in the system design process.

Design fundamentals are the foundational knowledge needed to design robust, functional, and scalable systems. 

This repo explores system design fundamentals that may be classified into 4 different categories:
* Underlying or Foundational Knowledge (e.g. Client-Server Model, Network Protocols)
* Key Characteristics of Systems (e.g. Availability, Throughput, Redundancy, Consistency)
* Actual Components (e.g. Load Balancers, Proxies, Caches, Rate Limiters, Leader Election)
* Actual Tech (e.g. Apache Zookeeper, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage)

_\*\* Note that this project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes only and it is **not** meant to be used for production._
