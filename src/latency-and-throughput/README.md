# Latency and Throughput  


## Prerequisites  
* Disk
* Memory

## Key Terms  
### Latency  
The time it takes for a certain operation to complete in a system. Most often this measure is a time duration, like milliseconds or seconds. You should know these orders of magnitude:  
* __Reading 1 MB from RAM__: 250 microseconds
* __Reading 1 MB from SSD__: 1000 microseconds
* __Transfer 1 MB over Network__: 10 milliseconds
* __REading 1 MB from HDD__: 20 milliseconds
* __Inter-Continental Round Trip__: 150 milliseconds

### Throughput  
The number of operations that a system can handle properly per time unit. For instance, the throughput of a server can often be measured in requests per seoncd (RPS or QPS).
