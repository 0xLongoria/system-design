## Key Term  
### Configuration  
A set of parameters or constants that are critical to a system. Configuration is typically written in __JSON__ or __YAML__ and can be either __static__, meaning that it's hard-coded in and shipped with your system's application code (like frontend code, for instance), or __dynamic)), meaning that it lives outside of your system's application code.
